# WPF C# Tutorial- Create a simple Binary Calculator game in Visual Studio
In this tutorial we are making a fun and simple binary calculator game using WPF C# in visual studio. We will be building on the previous tutorial. We will be using the GRID with more columns and rows for this app. We will be creating the game using buttons, labels and text boxes in which we will be randomly generating a number and ask the user to solve the number using binary methods only. 

I have tried to make the game as simple as possible and we will be going through this tutorial step by step. 

Hopefully you will find this tutorial useful. We are building toward doing more programming on games development only using WPF and C# from here on, so stay tuned.
